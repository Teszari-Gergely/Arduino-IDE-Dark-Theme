# Arduino-IDE-Dark-Theme
It is a simple and easy to install dark mode to Arduino IDE. Does not require to install anything, just modifies a little at the working IDE's own files.
# Detailed descripiton:
I've modified two files: theme.txt (location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib\theme\theme.txt) and default.xmel (location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib\theme\syntax\default.xml). 
Both of these file's mods are just color code modifications. 
I've included a little help in the downloadable .zip file, named ToDo.txt.
Have fun with eye care mode of the Arduino IDE :)
